## Our Pledge

At *Concur, we believe that **awareness and access* are the true foundations of privacy.  
Privacy should not be a privilege reserved for large organizations with deep resources - it is a *fundamental right* that every individual and organization, big or small, must be able to uphold.

Our mission is to *democratize privacy* by making powerful data protection and compliance tools accessible to everyone.  
We are building open, interoperable systems under the *Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)* vision - enabling every organization in India to implement privacy and compliance seamlessly, without cost being a barrier.

Through this open-source initiative, we aim to empower the next generation of data fiduciaries, developers, and innovators to build a privacy-respecting digital future.

If you share our vision of a fair, transparent, and privacy-first India - *join the movement, contribute to the cause, and be part of the privacy revolution.*

## Our Community Values

We are committed to maintaining a respectful, transparent, and inclusive community.  
To ensure that SAHAJ remains a healthy, productive, and welcoming environment for everyone, all participants agree to:

- Treat all contributors and users with *respect and empathy*.  
- Engage in *constructive discussions* and provide feedback that is helpful and kind.  
- Encourage diversity of thought and foster a sense of *shared ownership*.  
- Uphold ethical standards when handling data, code, or research.  
- Respect privacy in both communication and implementation.  
- Never use this project or its components for activities that violate privacy, data protection, or applicable laws.

## Developer Guidelines

To maintain high standards and ensure alignment with SAHAJ’s goals, contributors are expected to follow these development principles:

### 1. Code Quality
- Follow best practices in security, readability, and maintainability.  
- Use meaningful commit messages and follow established branching conventions.  
- Ensure all submitted code passes linting, testing, and security checks.  
- Include sufficient documentation and comments explaining complex logic.

### 2. Contribution Workflow
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from main (e.g., feature/add-consent-dashboard).  
- Submit a pull request (PR) describing your changes, rationale, and any dependencies.  
- Link related issues or feature requests for clarity.  
- Be open to review, discussion, and potential revision before merge.

## Feature Requests

We welcome suggestions that enhance privacy, usability, or interoperability.  
Before submitting a new feature request:

1. *Search existing issues* to avoid duplicates.  
2. Clearly describe:
   - The problem or limitation you’re trying to solve.  
   - The value it brings to privacy or compliance enablement.  
   - Any alternative solutions or prior discussions.  
3. Use the label feature-request when creating an issue.  
4. Avoid proposing features that introduce commercial dependencies or break the open-access philosophy.

Feature proposals that align with DPDPA compliance, DPI interoperability, or community benefit will be prioritized.
